I am an Associate Professor in [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/, "GSAI") / [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/ "CSE") / Medical Science and Engineering (MED) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and I run [Medical Information Processing (MIP) Lab](http://mip.postech.ac.kr "MIP") at POSTECH. 
My research is focused on interdisciplinary topics in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Medical Imaging. I am particularily interested in applied harmonic analysis in non-Euclidean spaces (e.g., signal processing on graphs) and stochastic process (e.g., longitudinal analysis) to develop efficient Deep Learning frameworks to facilitate understanding of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and brain function.

Notes for Prospective Students
-----
I am always looking for highly **self-motivated** students with long term goals.  
* I usually take 1-2 students per semester. 
* I can freely hire students from both Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI) and Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Hiring students from Medical Science and Engineering (MED) will depend on the funding situation. 
* If you are already at POSTECH and want to work on independent research (CSED 399/499), please email me directly. I usually advise 2-3 undergraduate students per semester. 
* I do not hire research interns. Please email me if you have questions regarding our group. 
<!-- I do not hire summer or winter interns as I make several (business) trips during those times.   -->
