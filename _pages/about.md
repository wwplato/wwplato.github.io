I am an Associate Professor in Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI) / Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) / Medical Science and Engineering (MSE) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). Prior to joining POSTECH, I was a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Arlington (2018 – 2023, last 2 years on leave-of-absence), and I was a Researcher in Data Science Team at NEC Labs., America (2017-2018). I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Wisconsin – Madison in 2017 thanks to great support from Prof. Vikas Singh (advisor). I got a M.S. in Robotics from KAIST (2010) and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University (2008), and I developed Hybrid Vehicles at Hyundai Motors Company in 2010-2011.
